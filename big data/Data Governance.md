### **Definition of Data Governance:**
Data governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used within an organization. It involves the establishment of processes, policies, standards, and metrics to ensure that data assets are managed effectively and efficiently. Data governance aims to maximize the value of data while minimizing risks associated with its use.
### **Importance of Data Governance in the Context of Big Data:**
In the era of Big Data, where organizations are dealing with vast amounts of data generated from various sources such as social media, IoT devices, and sensors, data governance becomes increasingly critical. Without proper governance, organizations risk facing issues such as data inconsistency, inaccuracies, security breaches, and compliance violations. Data governance provides a framework for addressing these challenges and enables organizations to harness the full potential of their data assets.
