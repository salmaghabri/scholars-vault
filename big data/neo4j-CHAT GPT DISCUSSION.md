## **what is the architecture used in no4j? is it master-worker? or ring?**
Neo4j is a graph database management system that uses a unique graph-based architecture to store and manage data. The architecture used in Neo4j is **neither master-worker nor ring**. Neo4j uses a distributed architecture that is based on a set of processes that work together to manage data. This architecture is commonly referred to as a &quot;cluster&quot; architecture, which allows Neo4j to distribute data and processing across multiple servers or nodes. In a Neo4j cluster, each node contains a subset of the data and has a unique role, such as a coordinator or a replica. The nodes communicate with each other using a messaging system toensure that data is consistent and up-to-date across the cluster. Therefore, the architecture used in Neo4j is based on a distributed cluster model, rather than amaster-worker or ring model.
## **do all the nodes communicate with all the others?**
In a Neo4j cluster, all nodes do not necessarily communicate with all the others. The way nodes communicate with each other depends on the configuration of the cluster and the role of each node. Neo4j uses a consensus-based replication protocol called Raft to ensure that data is consistent
across the cluster. In a Raft-based cluster, one node is elected as the &quot;leader&quot; and is responsible for coordinating updates to the cluster. The other nodes in the cluster are known as &quot;followers&quot;
and replicate data from the leader. The leader communicates directly with the followers, but the followers do not necessarily communicate with each other. Instead, they receive updates from the leader and apply them to
their local copy of the data. However, **in some cases**, nodes in a Neo4j cluster may communicate with each other directly. For example, when a client sends a query to the cluster, it may be routed through a coordinator
node, which communicates with the other nodes to execute the query.
Overall, the communication pattern between nodes in a Neo4j cluster depends on the specific configuration of the cluster and the tasks that each node is responsible for. 
## **what is causal consistency in neo4j**
Causal consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems, including Neo4j, that ensures that updates to the database are applied in a causally consistent order. In other words, if an update to the database depends on another previous update, then the dependent update
must be applied after the previous update. In Neo4j, causal consistency is achieved through a combination of **the Raft consensus protocol**
**and the use of versioned timestamps**. When a client sends a write operation to a Neo4j cluster, the operation is first sent to the leader node. The leader node then assigns a versioned timestamp to the operation, based on the current time and the state of the database at the time
the operation was received. The timestamp is used to determine the causal ordering of the operation with respect to other
operations in the database. If the operation depends on a previous operation, the timestamp ensures that the previous operation has already been applied before the dependent operation is applied. The versioned timestamps are also used to ensure that conflicts between concurrentoperations are resolved in a deterministic way.
Overall, causal consistency in Neo4j ensures that updates to the database are applied in a causally consistent order, which provides a stronger guarantee of consistency than weaker consistency models like eventual consistency. This makes it easier to reason about the state ofthe database and to build applications that depend on strong consistency guarantees.

## **does neo4j apply the read and write anywhere strategy?**
Yes, Neo4j uses a read-anywhere, write-anywhere strategy to manage data in a distributed cluster. This means that clients can read or write data to any node in the cluster, regardless of the node&#39;s role or location.
In a Neo4j cluster, each node contains a subset of the data and has a unique role, such as a coordinator or a replica. However, clients do not need to know the specific role of each node to access the data. Instead, clients can send read or write operations to any node in the cluster, and the cluster will handle routing the operation to the appropriate node. When a client sends a write operation to the cluster, the operation is first sent to the leader node,
which coordinates updates to the cluster. The leader node then replicates the update to the other nodes in the cluster, using a consensus-based replication protocol called Raft. This ensures that updates are applied consistently across the cluster. Similarly, when a client sends a read operation to the cluster, the operation can be routed to any node in the cluster. If the node does not contain the data needed to satisfy the read operation, it can forward the request to the appropriate node. This allows clients to access data from any
node in the cluster, which can improve performance and availability in distributed environments.
Overall, the read-anywhere, write-anywhere strategy used by Neo4j provides a flexible and scalable approach to managing data in a distributed cluster.

## **how is sharding done in neo4j**
Sharding in Neo4j is achieved by dividing the graph data into multiple partitions called &quot;shards&quot;
and distributing the shards across multiple nodes in a cluster. Each shard is a subset of the
graph data that can be stored on a single node or across multiple nodes.
There are several ways to shard graph data in Neo4j, including:
1. Range-based sharding: In range-based sharding, the graph data is partitioned based ona range of values, such as node or relationship IDs. Each node or relationship isassigned to a specific shard based on its ID range. This approach ensures that nodesand relationships that are closely related are stored in the same shard, which canimprove query performance.
2. Hash-based sharding: In hash-based sharding, the graph data is partitioned based on a hash function applied to the node or relationship ID. The output of the hash function determines which shard the node or relationship is assigned to. This approach ensures that data is distributed evenly across the cluster, which can improve load balancing.
3. Property-based sharding: In property-based sharding, the graph data is partitioned based on the value of a specific property, such as the node label or a user-defined property. Nodes or relationships with the same property value are assigned to the same shard. This approach can be useful for partitioning data based on business logic, rather than ID  ranges or hash functions.Once the data is sharded, Neo4j uses a distributed consensus protocol, such as Raft, to ensurethat the data is replicated and consistent across the cluster. The cluster can also be configured toallow for automatic shard rebalancing, which redistributes shards across the cluster to maintain even load distribution and improve performance.
Overall, sharding in Neo4j allows for scalable and distributed storage of graph data, which can improve performance and availability in large-scale applications.

## **what is the role of neo4j fabric**
Neo4j Fabric is a feature in Neo4j that provides a virtualization layer for distributed data management. It allows multiple Neo4j database instances to be connected and treated as a single, unified graph database. This enables developers to build applications that can seamlessly
access and analyze data from multiple sources, without having to manage the complexities of distributed data management.
The main role of Neo4j Fabric is to provide a unified view of graph data across multiple Neo4jdatabase instances. It does this by providing a set of tools and APIs that enable developers to:
1. Connect to multiple Neo4j database instances: Fabric allows developers to connect tomultiple Neo4j databases, each containing a different subset of the overall graph data.
2. Query and analyze distributed graph data: Fabric provides tools for executing queriesacross multiple Neo4j databases and aggregating the results. This allows developers toanalyze graph data that is distributed across multiple sources.
3. Manage distributed data: Fabric provides tools for managing the distribution of graphdata across multiple Neo4j databases, including automatic shard rebalancing and datareplication.
4. Integrate with other data sources: Fabric can be used to integrate graph data from Neo4j
with data from other sources, such as relational databases or document stores.
Overall, the role of Neo4j Fabric is to simplify the process of building applications that require access to graph data from multiple sources. It provides a unified view of graph data acrossdistributed Neo4j databases, and provides tools for managing and analyzing that data in a scalable and efficient manner.

## **and where is it situated? in which node?**
Neo4j Fabric is implemented as a separate service that can be deployed on a separate node in a Neo4j cluster. This separate Fabric node acts as a gateway to the distributed graph data, providing a unified view of the data and managing communication between client applications
and the distributed Neo4j databases.
When a client application sends a query to Neo4j Fabric, the Fabric node routes the query to the appropriate Neo4j database instances, aggregates the results, and returns them to the client application. The client application is unaware of the underlying distributed nature of the data, and
interacts with the graph data as if it were a single, unified database.
By deploying Neo4j Fabric as a separate service on a separate node, it can be scaled independently from the Neo4j databases, allowing for increased flexibility and scalability in managing distributed graph data.

## **isn't this a master worker architecture? where fabric is the master?**
Yes, Neo4j Fabric can be considered a master-worker architecture, where the Fabric node acts as the master and the distributed Neo4j databases act as the workers. The Fabric node receivesqueries from client applications and forwards them to the appropriate Neo4j databases for processing. The results are then aggregated by the Fabric node and returned to the clientapplication.However, it&#39;s worth noting that Neo4j Fabric **is not strictly a master-worker architecture in the traditional sense**, since the workers in this case are not simply executing tasks assigned to themby the master. Instead, the Fabric node is responsible for routing queries to the appropriate workers and managing communication between the client application and the distributed Neo4jdatabases. The workers themselves are responsible for executing queries and returning results, but they are not explicitly managed by the Fabric node in the same way that workers are managed in a traditional master-worker architecture.
## **where are the metadata stored?**
In Neo4j, the metadata about the graph database, such as schema information and indexdefinitions, are stored in a separate system database called the &quot;neo4j system database&quot;. This
system database is separate from the user graph data, and is managed internally by Neo4j.The system database contains information about the structure and configuration of the graph
database, including:
 **Schema information**: Information about the labels, relationships, and properties that
make up the graph schema.
 **Index definitions**: Information about the indexes that have been created on the graph data.
 **Configuration settings:** Settings that configure how Neo4j operates, such as memory
settings and logging levels.
 **User and role definitions**: Information about the users and roles defined in the graphdatabase.
The system database is managed by Neo4j and is not intended to be directly accessed or modified by users or applications. Instead, users and applications can interact with the metadata through Neo4j&#39;s APIs and query language.

## **how does neo4j deal with the sharding of subgraphs that have common nodes**
Neo4j uses a technique called &quot;reference nodes&quot; to handle the sharding of subgraphs that havecommon nodes. A reference node is a special type of node in Neo4j that does not contain any data itself, but instead serves as a reference to other nodes in the graph. When a subgraph is sharded across multiple Neo4j instances, any nodes that are shared between the subgraphs are represented by reference nodes in each of the instances. These reference nodes have the same unique identifier in each instance, and serve as a way to link thesubgraphs together. When a query is executed on the sharded graph, the Neo4j Fabric service retrieves the relevant data from each of the Neo4j instances that hold a portion of the graph data, and combines the results into a single result set. This allows queries to be executed across the entire graph, even when the subgraphs being queried are sharded across multiple instances.
Overall, the use of reference nodes in Neo4j allows for efficient sharding of subgraphs, while stillmaintaining the ability to query across the entire graph, including subgraphs with common nodes.

## **is the content of the node duplicated in both shards or does it exist in only one machine?**
In Neo4j, the content of a node is typically only stored on one machine, even if the node is part of a sharded subgraph. When a subgraph is sharded across multiple Neo4j instances, each instance stores a portion of the overall graph data, but each node in the graph typically only exists in one instance. When a query is executed on the sharded graph, the Neo4j Fabric service retrieves the relevant data from each of the Neo4j instances that hold a portion of the graph data, and combines the results into a single result set. This allows queries to be executed across the entire graph, even when the subgraphs being queried are sharded across multiple instances.
However, it is worth noting that in some cases, Neo4j may use a technique called &quot;replication&quot; to replicate data across multiple machines for increased fault tolerance and redundancy. In a replicated setup, the content of a node may be duplicated across multiple machines for increased availability in the event of a machine failure. However, this is not the default behavior in a sharded setup, and nodes are typically stored on a single machine.
## **are replicas situated in the same cluster than the leader nodes, or in a separate one?**
In Neo4j, replicas are typically situated in the same cluster as the leader nodes. In a Neo4j cluster, there are typically multiple nodes that can serve as the leader, and each of these leader nodes can have one or more replicas. When a wr te operation is performed on a leader node in the cluster, the changes are
immediately propagated to all of the replicas for that leader. This ensures that the data is consistent across all of the nodes in the cluster, even in the event of a failure or network partition. By keeping the replicas in the same cluster as the leader nodes, Neo4j is able to provide high availability and fault tolerance without sacrificing performance or increasing network latency. This is because the replicas are able to communicate with the leader nodes directly, without the need for additional network hops or complex routing mechanisms.

## **is a duplicated node in two subgraphs considered to be replica**
In Neo4j, a duplicated node in two subgraphs that are sharded across multiple machines is not typically considered a replica. Instead, it is simply two separate nodes that happen to have the same label and properties.
In a sharded setup, each node typically exists on only one machine, and is not replicated to other machines unless explicit replication is configured. So if a node exists in two separate subgraphs, it will typically exist as two separate nodes, one on each of the machines that holds the relevant portion of the subgraph.
It is worth noting that Neo4j does provide support for explicit replication, which allows nodes to be replicated to multiple machines for increased fault tolerance and redundancy. In a replicated setup, a node may exist on multiple machines, with changes to the node being automatically propagated to all of the replicas. However, this is not the default behavior in a sharded setup, and duplicated nodes are typically treated as separate nodes that happen to have the same label and properties.

## **you said earlier that neo4j uses read and write anywhere strategy, then you said that is uses fabric to route the queries to the appropriate shard... I am confused**
I apologize for any confusion. Let me clarify. Neo4j uses a &quot;read anywhere&quot; strategy, which means that any node in a Neo4j cluster can serve read requests without the need for a centralized read coordinator. This means that reads can be performed locally on the node that receives the request, without the need for additional network hops or coordination.
However, when it comes to writes, Neo4j uses a &quot;write anywhere&quot; strategy in conjunction with the
Neo4j Fabric service. When a write request is received by a node in the cluster, that node
forwards the request to the appropriate shard for the data being written. The Fabric service is
responsible for routing the write request to the correct shard, based on the partitioning scheme
that has been configured for the graph.
In other words, writes can be performed on any node in the cluster, but the write request will be
forwarded to the appropriate shard for the data being written. This allows writes to be performed
locally on the node that receives the request, while still ensuring that the data is written to the
correct shard in the cluster.
Similarly, when a query is executed on the sharded graph, the Neo4j Fabric service is
responsible for routing the query to the appropriate shards, and then combining the results from
each shard into a single result set. This allows queries to be executed across the entire graph,
even when the subgraphs being queried are sharded across multiple instances.
I hope this clarifies things!

## **what which machine communicates directly with the client?**
In a Neo4j cluster, any node in the cluster can communicate directly with a client application.When a client sends a request to the cluster, the request is forwarded to one of the nodes in the cluster, which can then process the request and send the response back to the client.
However, it is common to use a load balancer or proxy server in front of the Neo4j cluster to distribute client requests across the available nodes in the cluster. This helps to distribute the load more evenly across the cluster, and can also provide additional benefits such as SSL termination, request logging, and health checks.
The load balancer or proxy server typically communicates directly with the client, and then
forwards the request to one of the nodes in the cluster. This allows the client to communicate
with a single endpoint, rather than having to maintain connections to each of the nodes in the
cluster.
## **but then where is fabric**
Neo4j Fabric is a separate service that is used to route requests and queries to the appropriate shards in a sharded cluster. Fabric is typically deployed as a separate service or set of services that run alongside the Neo4j cluster.
When a client application sends a request or query to the Neo4j cluster, the request is typicallyrouted through the load balancer or proxy server to one of the nodes in the cluster. That nodethen forwards the request to the appropriate shard using the Fabric service. The Fabric serviceuses metadata about the graph topology to determine which shard contains the relevant data,and then routes the request to that shard.
In summary, Fabric is not directly involved in communication between the client and the Neo4jcluster, but rather is used to route requests and queries within the cluster itself.

## **is the fabric service installed in every node of the cluster**
No, the Fabric service is not installed on every node in the Neo4j cluster. Instead, the Fabric
service is typically deployed as a separate set of services that run alongside the Neo4j cluster. The Fabric service typically consists of two components: a routing tier and a transaction coordinator. The routing tier is responsible for receiving requests and queries from client applications and routing them to the appropriate shard for processing. The transaction coordinator is responsible for coordinating transactions across multiple shards, ensuring that transactions are executed atomically across the entire graph.
The routing tier can be deployed as a separate set of services, such as a load balancer or proxy server, that sit in front of the Neo4j cluster. The transaction coordinator is typically deployed as a separate set of services that run on dedicated nodes in the cluster.
By deploying the Fabric service as a separate set of services, it can be scaled independently from the Neo4j cluster, allowing for greater flexibility in configuring and optimizing the overall system.
