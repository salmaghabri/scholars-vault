- artifacts refer to the output of various stages in the software development life cycle.
# Build Artifacts
- a build artifact is a compiled version of source code that has been processed by a build system. 
## Types of Build Artifacts
#### Executable files
These are files that can be run on a specific operating system or platform.
#### librairies
These are files that can be run on a specific operating system or platform.
### Configuration files
These are files that contain settings and parameters for a specific application or
system.
# Deployment Artifacts
the collection of files and configurations that are needed to deploy an application or service. These artifacts are created during the build process and include everything necessary to run the application in a production environment.
Executable files
Configuration files
Database scripts
# Testing Artifacts
Test Cases
Test cases are a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will
determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works
correctly.
Test Plans
A test plan is a document detailing the objectives, resources, and processes
for a specific test for a software or hardware product.
Test Suites
A test suite is a collection of test cases that are intended to be used to test a
software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviors.
# Monitoring Artifacts
monitoring artifacts are used to track and analyze system performance and behavior. 
include system logs, metrics, and traces. Logs provide a record of system
events, while metrics measure system performance and behavior. Traces provide a detailed view of system transactions and can be used to identify
issues .
